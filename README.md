# vimrc
I am getting started with vim , for python.

-If you want to install more plugins just place that plug statement in .vimrc between
</br>call plug#begin()
</br>Plug "--something--"
</br>call plug#end()


Some basic things, I use frequently in vim
1. Leader key is set to <space>.
2. Arrow keys are disabled. (for being efficient)
3. While in Insert mode if you want to move to end of the line press CTRL-E and for the top of the line press CTRL-A.
4. Most used commenting feature that comes with NERDcommentor.
 </br> Press Leader+cc - To comment out the whole line your cursor is on.
 </br>Press Leader+c$ - To comment from where your cursor is to the end of the line.
5. Auto-matic indentation is enabled for python.
